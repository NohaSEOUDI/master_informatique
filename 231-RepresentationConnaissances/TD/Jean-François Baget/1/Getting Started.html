  Introduction

Protege is an OWL ontology development environment. This getting started
guide forms part of the Protege Desktop user documentation and is
designed to get you up and running with the tool.

In just a few minutes you should be able to install Protege, load an
ontology, navigate around it, use a reasoner to classify it and
configure the interface to your taste.


  Download, Install and Start Protégé

If you haven’t already done so, you need to download and install Protege
Desktop from the Protege website
<http://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#desktop-protege>. Please
follow the step-by-step instructions to install Protege
<https://protegeproject.github.io/protege/installation>.


  Open the Pizza Ontology

Open the Pizza ontology from the Web. From the *File* menu choose *Open
from URL…*. A dialog will be displayed asking you whether you want to
open the ontology in the current window. Choose *No*. In the next
dialog, enter *http://protege.stanford.edu/ontologies/pizza/pizza.owl*
in the URI field and press *OK*.

You will now be presented with the main Protege workspace, which
displays the *Active Ontology* tab by default. This tab shows an
overview of the “active” ontology, including metrics on its contents,
annotations on the ontology, and imported ontologies. The drop-down box
on the toolbar displays the current active ontology, that is to say, the
one into which all edits take place. When working on a single ontology
this concept of the active ontology is not a concern. The top right of
the toolbar is home to the *Search…* button, which can be pressed to
open the search window. This search window can also be opened by
pressing *CTRL+F* (or *CMD+F* on a Mac).

  Navigation

Now switch to the *Entities Tab*.

The Entities tab is the workhorse of the ontology editor. From this
location, you can explore all of the classes, properties, and
individuals in an ontology. As you may have already noticed, each *tab*
is made up of several *views* which can be resized, removed, floated,
split, and layered (more about views later). The selection model is
global: when a class, property or individual is selected in the trees on
the left-hand side, the right pane changes to display the selection
immediately. In addition, most views implement *hypertext navigation* so
that links can be followed easily regardless of which view you are
using. Opening up the hierarchies and selecting a class or property
displays the appropriate description on the right. Backward and forward
navigation is possible with the left and right arrow buttons in the
toolbar, which act just like a Web browser.

The Entities tab
The Entities tab. Here, the class Country is selected in the Class
Hierarchy (Tree) on the left hand side. The right hand side displays
information about the selected entity (in this case Country).

Another easy way to navigate around the contents of an ontology is to
perform a search. The *Search…* button in the toolbar performs a global
search in the loaded ontologies. In addition, the various hierarchy
views have their own search dialogs (to activate a view search dialog,
click anywhere in the required view to give it focus, then press
*CTRL+F* (or *CMD+F* on a Mac).


  Reasoning

Reasoning over your ontology is a commonly performed activity and
Protege comes with a built-in reasoner called HermiT
<http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/>. To reason over your ontology, open
the *Reasoner* menu and select *HermiT*. Next press *Ctrl+R* (or *CMD+R*
on a Mac). This will start the reasoner. After the reasoner finishes you
can inspect your ontology to view inferred information. For example,
select American in the class hierarchy (under NamedPizza, which is under
Pizza, which is under Food, which is under DomainConcept). Notice that
some of the information on the right hand side is displayed with a
yellow background - this is inferred information. In other words, it is
information that has been computed by the reasoner.

You can also switch to the inferred class hierarchy using the drop down
box in the top right of the class hierarchy. Notice the difference
between this inferred hierarchy (the hierarchy computed by the reasoner)
and the asserted hierarchy (the hierarchy written down in the ontology).

There are other reasoners available for Protege, including Pellet and
FaCT++. These reasoners are available for download from the *File >
Check for plugins…* menu item.

The Auto Update Dialog
Selecting File > Check for plugins... opens the Auto-Update dialog. From
here you can install various plugins such as Reasoners.


  Investigate other tabs

  *

    *OWLViz* - requires installation of GraphViz
    <http://www.graphviz.org/> before anything will be visible. This tab
    shows a graphical representation of the class subsumption hierarchy.
    A full description of OWLViz is available in the OWLViz manual
    <https://github.com/protegeproject/owlviz>.

  *

    *DL Query* - requires the ontology to have been classified before it
    will return results. An arbitrary class description can be entered
    and the reasoner is queried for the sub/super classes, inferred
    members, etc., depending on what is selected.


  Investigate views

Each tab is made up of multiple views - each with its own perspective on
the ontology, or just one aspect of the ontology (like the last selected
class).

Views can be stacked on top of each other, in which case you will see
additional tabs for exposing them. Examples of this are the usage views
that are by default on the Entities, Classes, Properties and Individuals
tabs. Select the tab to make the view visible.

All of the views that are on tabs by default and many more that aren’t
are listed in the *Views* menu. You can add and remove views to create
you own custom interfaces (see below).


  Reconfigure the User Interface

Reconfiguring the user interface is easy. Adding and removing tabs and
views is possible through the Tabs and View menus. Try adding a view to
the Entities tab:

 1. Switch to the *Entities Tab*
 2. Select a class to make sure the Selected Entity view is showing
    class views.
 3. Select *Window > Views > Class Views > Superclass hierarchy*. Now,
    when you move the mouse pointer over the Entities tab, a blue
    outline shows where the new view will be dropped - either on top of,
    above, below, left, or right of each of the current views. Move the
    mouse around to see how this works.
 4. When happy with the position, click the left mouse button to drop
    the view (if you want to cancel this operation just click somewhere
    on the toolbar instead).
 5. The superclass tree view is now visible (the tree shows the
    “upside-down” version of the subclass tree, using the current class
    as the root).

All changes will be saved when Protege is properly shut down (or the
save can be forced by selecting “Save current layout” in the Window menu).

  Human Readable Entity Names

Many ontologies, in particular biomedical ontologies, use alpha-numeric
codes as the identifiers of classes, properties and individuals. If your
class hierarchy just looks like a jumble of numbers or other
computer-generated codes, but you have labels for each entity, you can
ask Protege to use these labels when displaying entities instead.

 1. Select *File > Preferences*.
 2. Select the *Renderer* tab of the preferences dialog.
 3. Choose *Render entities using annotation values*.
 4. Where labels are provided, Protege will now display these in all
    views. If a label is missing it will continue to show the entity’s Id.
 5. The annotation that is getting used to render the label (as well as
    the language) can be selected by pressing the *Annotations…* button.

The current renderer selected will be preserved next time you open
Protege to save this step in the future.

The Renderer preferences
The renderer preferences. The Entity rendering section specifies how the
names of classes, properties and individuals should be derived and
displayed in the user interface. Here, "Render by annotation property"
is selected, meaning that if an entity has an annotation, such as an
rdfs:label, the value of this annotation will be used for the entity
display name.
