Syntax <https://protegeproject.github.io/protege/class-expression-syntax/>

Class expressions are used to describe individuals that share common
characteristics. This includes both *class names* (or named classes) and
*complex class expressions*. The table below presents the keywords that
are used to build up complex class expressions along with some examples.
Class expressions can be nested to arbitrary depths in order to build up
rich descriptions of the domain being modelled.

The Manchester OWL Syntax <http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/>
is used for presenting and writing various kinds of complex expressions
in Protégé. This page provides a brief overview of the class expression
syntax.


    Class Expression Syntax

Keyword 	Example 	Intuitive Meaning
some 	hasPet some Dog 	Things that have a pet that is a Dog
This is the most common type of class expression. Also known as, an
"SomeValueFrom restriction" or an "Existential Restriction". This kind
of class expression consists of a property (in this case hasPet) and a
class expression that is known as a filler (in this case the filler is
Dog).

Individuals that are instances of this class expression have a
relationship along the hasPet property to an individual that is an
instance of class Dog.
value 	hasPet value Tibbs 	Things that have a pet that is Tibbs.
Here, Tibbs is a specific individual. Intuitively this would describe
Tibb's owners. Note that this is a short cut for, and logically
equivalent to, (hasPet some {Tibbs}), where the curly brackets describe
a class of specific individuals - in this case, a class of one
individual that is Tibbs. Also known as a "HasValue restriction"
only 	hasPet only Cat 	Things that have pets that are only Cats.
Note that this does not mean that these things must have a Cat, but if
they do have a pet then it will be a Cat. Also known as an
"AllValuesFrom restriction" or a "Universal restriction"
min 	hasPet min 3 Cat 	Things that have at least three pets that are Cats.
Things that have at least three pets that are Cats. Also known as a "Min
cardinality restriction"
max 	hasPet max 5 Dog 	Things that have at most five pets that are Dogs.
Note that there may be more than five pets in total e.g. three Cats and
five Dogs, but the number of Dogs will not be more than five. This class
expression also means that there may be no pets at all. Also known as a
"Max cardinality restriction"
exactly 	hasPet exactly 2 GoldFish 	Things that have exactly 2 GoldFish
as pets.
Note that there may be more than two pets, but two of the pets are
GoldFish - no more and no less. Also known as an "Exact cardinality
restriction"
and 	Person and (hasPet some Cat) 	People that have a pet that's a Cat.
Here we have a class name and a complex class expression combined with
the and keyword. The brackets are optional in this particular case, but
have been included for clarity. Also known as an "Intersection" or a
"Conjunction". We also say that each class expression in the conjunction
is a "conjunct".
or 	(hasPet some Cat) or (hasPet some Dog) 	Things that have a pet
that's a Cat or have a pet that's a Dog
Note that the or is not exclusive. That is, this class includes the
things that have a Cat as a pet, or have a Dog as a pet, or have both a
pet Dot and a pet Cat. Note that we could have also written this example
as (hasPet some (Cat or Dog)) Also known as a "Union" or a
"Disjunction". We also say that each class expression in the disjunction
is a "disjunct".
not 	not (hasPet some Dog) 	Things that do not have a pet that's a dog.
This includes things that either do not have any pet, or if they have a
pet then it's not a Dog. Note that this is logically equivalent to
(hasPet only (not Dog)) Also known as a "negation".
